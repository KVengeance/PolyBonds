Decentralised Token for PolyBonds

PolyBond token is the reward token for the PolyBond Protocol on the Polygon network.

The PolyBond Protocol was born out of a love for crypto, exhaustion of scammy crap and a desire to return to the united crypto community that preceeded the days of quick money making rug pulls.

HOW DOES IT WORK

PolyBonds are essentially based on Premium Bonds - a saving, reward and sweepstake protocol in one ecosystem.

Protocol Breakdown

1. Deposit Matic
2. Stake Matic/Bond in Liquidity pool
3. n% Rewards returned in Bond to holders
4. n% Rewards donated to Charity
5. n% Rewards returned in lottery to token holders
6. Withdraw Stake at anytime

DAO implementation

The DAO decides on the n% distribution via ballot.
